Type Less do More:
	semicolons:
		treats end-of-line as end of statements or an expression
		can use semicolons if multiple statements are in the same line
		case clause need not be covered with curly braces
			case a => 
				println
				exit	
	
	variable declarations:
		immutable variable is declared with val
			must be initialized when declared
		mutable variable is declared with var
			array reference cannot be changed to point to a different array, but it can be change
		immutable is consistent with the principles of pure functional programming
	
	method declarations
		sequence
			- start with a def keyword
			- optional argument list
			- colon character
			- return type
			- equal sign
			- method body
		if a method body has more than one expression, should be surrounded with curly braces
		if a method body has only one expression, curly braces can be omitted
		
		method default and named arguments
			default values for parameters can be defined
				def function(param1: type, param2: String = " "): Unit = {}
				can declare
					def join(first: String , second: String = "not given"): Unit = println("hello " + first + second)
				and call
					join("murali") will give hello murali not given
			named arguments
